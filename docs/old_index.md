# Working with NEON Airborne Remote Sensing Data in Google Earth Engine

!!! info "Workshop Overview"
    Learn to harness the power of NEON's airborne remote sensing data through hands-on exercises in Google Earth Engine. This workshop combines ecological insights with cutting-edge cloud computing for regional-scale environmental analysis.

## :satellite: About This Workshop

The U.S. NSF's **National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)** offers extensive ecological data across various temporal and spatial scales. NEON's **Airborne Observation Platform (AOP)** captures high-resolution hyperspectral imagery, lidar, and RGB photography at **81 U.S. sites**, with data spanning 2-10 years. 

In 2024, **5 AOP datasets** were added to the Google Earth Engine publisher catalog, providing another means of accessing and working with NEON data.
