# Getting Started

This guide will help you prepare for the workshop by setting up your Google Earth Engine account and understanding the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have basic familiarity with Google Earth Engine and experience coding in a scientific language (e.g., Python, R, JavaScript) is recommended. Participants must sign up for a Google Earth Engine account and set up a cloud project to follow along with the live-coding exercises.

## Setup Instructions

To follow along during the workshop, or to run through the tutorials contained within the repository using the Google Earth Engine Code Editor, the following steps are required.

### 1. Google Earth Engine Account
Create a Noncommercial Google Earth Engine account (if you don't already have one) at <https://earthengine.google.com/noncommercial/>

### 2. Google Earth Engine Project
Once your EE account is set up, you will need to create a Google Cloud project. This is required to run the live-coding exercises. You can follow the instructions in the [Google Earth Engine access guide](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/access) to set up your project.

### 3. Hardware Requirements
Following along with the exercises requires a laptop or tablet with a stable internet connection.

## Next Steps

Once you've completed the setup above, you'll be ready to participate in the workshop exercises. Make sure to test your Google Earth Engine access by logging into the [Earth Engine Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) before the workshop begins.

If you encounter any issues during setup, please reach out to the workshop organizers for assistance.

<!-- 2. **NEON User accout and API token**
    - Create a NEON User account (if you don't already have one) following the instructions here: <https://www.neonscience.org/about/user-accounts/>
    - Create an API token and save this; you will use this to download and access NEON data during the workshop and beyond. Instructions on creating an API token can be found here: <https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neon-api-tokens-tutorial> -->
