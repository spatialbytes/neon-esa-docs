# NEON Airborne Remote Sensing in GEE Tutorials

!!! tip "Open Science Initiative"
    Welcome to the **NEON Airborne Remote Sensing in Google Earth Engine Resources** workshop! This community-driven resource provides comprehensive tutorials for working with AOP raster data products in Google Earth Engine.

## :material-satellite-variant: About This Repository

This workshop offers hands-on tutorials to help researchers, students, and practitioners work with **NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP)** data products in Google Earth Engine. You can find the [slide deck here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1w6QsyhGLi_xK7JLURXgmrrFetWC7LG9EP7WOXqtTEVs/edit?usp=sharing). Our tutorials cover data generated from three primary sensors:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-camera: **Hyperspectral Imaging**

    ---

    High-resolution spectral data for vegetation analysis and species classification

    **426 spectral bands** | **1m spatial resolution**

-   :material-radar: **LiDAR Sensors**

    ---

    3D structural data for canopy height and biomass estimation

    **Point clouds** | **Derived products**

-   :material-camera-outline: **RGB Camera**
